## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a team builder for Pokèmon games.

The available Pokémon will go from the 1st to the 7th generation (excluding the 8th generation as it came out on November 15th 2019)

## What is your motivation for creating this project?

I'm a Pokèmon player since I was a child. One of the most fun parts of Pokèmon games is composing your own team for adventure or competition.

I also want to test my knowledge by building something of my own.

## How will users interact with your web site?

The user will be able to create teams in which to add their own Pokemon, with a maximum of 6 Pokémon per team.

## What 3rd Party API(s) will you integrate with?

* [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) - The RESTful Pokémon API

## Tech Stack

* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (XY Grids only for basic responsive design)
* Local Storage for saving the teams

### What project management tool will you use?

I will use GitHub Projects

### How often will you commit your code?

Every day, if possible.

### How will you test your web site?

For now I don't use any test frameworks and I will test it by myself. I will offer my friends the possibility of using it to gather feedback or to let me know about any bugs present.

### How will you design the layout of your website? Will you use a wireframing tool? Will you draw it on paper?

Design's layout will be drawn on paper and uploaded in this repository once finished.
